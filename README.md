5. Captain B selects 1 hero

### Stage Two

1. Three maps are randomly selected
2. Captain B bans 1 map
3. Captain A bans 1 map
4. The remaining map is the chosen battleground
5. Rerolls for each captain are restored
6. 6 new randomly generated heroes appear
7. Captain B selects 1 hero
8. Captain A selects 2 heroes
9. Captain B selects 1 hero

The draft is now complete! Use the copy tool button to share the selected talents with your team.

**You can also reroll during both stages, rerolls will randomly assign a new set of 6 heroes**

### Hero Selection

Whenever a hero is selected from the pool of 6 heroes, a new one is generated to maintain the available options.

## Points Suggestion for Tournaments

To encourage players to stick to the given builds during tournaments, organizers can implement a point system. Each wrong talent selected could lead to a loss of points upon victory. Consistent rule-breaking may result in further punishment. This system helps maintain the integrity of the draft tool and ensures a fair and competitive environment.

## Share Tool Button

The share tool button allows players to easily paste the build into the Heroes of the Storm in-game chat. The build will appear as a talent set for the given character. To use the shared talent set, click on the talent set text, then the gear icon, and finally copy the talent set to position number 1 (or the desired position). In the game, simply select the favorited talents to follow the drafted build.

## Conclusion

Experience a new level of drafting strategy with the Heroes of the Storm Draft Tool. Create balanced teams with diverse hero options and map selections, and share your drafted talents with your teammates. Implement a point system for tournaments to maintain fair competition. Give it a try and elevate your Heroes of the Storm gameplay!
